When I was growing up, I always heard that if you choose a job you love, you will never have to work a day in your life. For the longest time, I had no idea what I wanted to be when I grew up. It wasn’t until my first web development course that I suddenly knew exactly what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.

For nearly every assignment in my web development class, I found myself completely immersed in the projects. Hours would pass by and I wouldn’t even notice because I loved it so much. To this day, I still lose track of time when I’m coding, and I love it even more now than I did then. 

When I’m not nose deep in code, you can find me keeping up with my Goodreads reading challenge, catching up on my many tv shows, or going on adventures with my husband, Jesse.
